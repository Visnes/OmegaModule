# Omega Module

This mod adds an endgame Omega Module that combines the effects of Speed, Efficiency, Productivity and Quality modules into a single module item.


## Design notes
- Each tier adds the effects of the other for modules
- Easy mode can be toogled in the settings under Startup. This makes the recipe to create these modules only require other modules, not other resources.
- Omega Module 1 requires the research of Space Science Pack and all other tier one modules.
- Omega Module 2 requires the research of Vulcanus, Gleba, Fulgora and all other tier two modules.
- Omega Module 3 requires the research of Aquilo and all other tier three modules.
- Since Factorio calculates weight based on different factors that can't be controlled by mods, these are some heavy modules
