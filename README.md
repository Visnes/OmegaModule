## Notes
- Each tier adds the effects of the other four modules
- Easy mode can be toogled in the settings under Startup. This makes the recipe to create these modules only require other modules, not other resources
- There is a hefty polution penalty when using these 10%/25%/50% for tier 1-3 respectivly
- You can turn off the polution penalty in settings
- Omega Module 1 requires the discovery of Vulcanus, Gleba, Fulgora and the research of all other tier 1 modules
- Omega Module 2 requires the discovery of Aquilo and the research of all other tier 2 modules
- Omega Module 3 requires the research of captivity, promethium science packs and all other tier 3 modules
- Since Factorio calculates weight based on different factors that can't be controlled by mods, these are some heavy modules
- You can transport tier 1 and 2 with space ship, but tier 3 is to heavy
- If you turn on easy recipes you can transport all modules by space ship
- You can toggle which effects the omega module has in settings
- You can multiply the cost of the modules research cost (range is 0-10 where 0 is half the cost of default)
