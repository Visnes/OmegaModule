Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-11-17
  Added:
    - You can now toggle which effect you want to be active with the Omega Module. All effects on by default
    - You can now multiply the research cost of the Omega Module. 1 is default (range is 0-10 where 0 is half the cost of default)
  Updates:
    - Made the research more expensive since they are so powerful. Tier 1-3 requires 5000/10000/50000 sciences packs respectively
      - Tier 1 now requires processing unit, tungsten carbide, holmium plate, bioflux and modules
      - Tier 2 now requires quantum-processor and modules
      - Tier 3 now requires 10 of speed 3, efficiency 3, productivity 3, quality 3 and omega 2, and will also need one full stack of each of the following: pentapod eggs, supercapacitors, quantum processors and tungsten plates.
    - Moved the unlock of tier 1 to after having unlocked all mid planets (Gleba, Vulcanus and Fulgora)
    - Moved the unlock of tier 2 to Aquilo
    - Tier 3 now requires promethium science pack to unlock
  Bugs
    - Cleaned up some of the code
    - Also fixed a typo where the easy tier 3 recipe was *very* expensive
